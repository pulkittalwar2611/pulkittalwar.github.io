<p>This post describes the journey of what I went through while preparing for my OSCP exam.</p>

<p>I had earlier given exams like Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) from eLearn Security and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) v10, but OSCP is no where close to the level of anxiety and preparation that is involved.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>

<p>It all started when I was given the oppurtunity by my organisation to fund my OSCP certification. On 24th May 2021 I had enrolled myself for the labs which were scheduled from 11th July 2021 onwards. I was passively preparing for OSCP from Januray 2021 by solving <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OSCP like machines</code> on <a href="https://github.com/rkhal101/Hack-the-Box-OSCP-Preparation/blob/master/.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-11.58.24-am.png">Hackthebox</a> whenever I used to get time, for instance few hours on weekends</p>

<p>I started giving my 100% from 24th May 2021, as I have a regular job I knew itâ€™ll be very tough managing time for me.</p>

<p>I generally studied after my office from 10pm to 4am sometimes 5am, I was making sure to give atleast 6-7 hours on weekdays and 14-16 hours on weekends and holidays.</p>

<p>Before my labs started I had approximately 1-1.5 months of time. I thought to utilise this time by starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Offsensive Security Proving Grounds: Play</code>. From 25th May to around 10th July 2021 I had rooted 35-40 boxes. If you want to check the list of boxes, please check this <a href="">link</a>.</p>

<h2 id="my-lab-time">My Lab Time</h2>

<p>My labs started from 11th July 2021 to 11th October 2021 (For 3 months). I had a very clear goal in mind, root as many machines as soon as possible. But any how that wasnâ€™t going to happen on an everyday basis, somedays office work was more which lead to no study time and sometimes I was too exhausted to study.</p>

<p>The time which I was not able to study due to office/personal work, I made sure to took a leave from office and then coverup for the gone time, on those days I was studying just like weekends from 14-16 hours.</p>

<p>Somedays were good too, when you once get into the flow of pawning machines then you just switch from one IP to another and continue submitting flags, It happened with me too when I used to root 2-3 machines on weekdays within 6-7 hours (rare cases though).</p>

<p>Never under estimate the OSCP labs, the level of machines varies from easy to impossible, there were days when I had to look at the screen for 3-4 hours continuously and couldnâ€™t find anything. Sleeping with this disappointment was the worst feeling for me.</p>

<p>I would say OSCP tests you in multiple ways two of which are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consitency</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patience</code>. Studying for OSCP itself is a very long phase, you have to sacrifice multiple things like no parties, no weekend outings etc. All these things makes you a consistent and patience plays a major part in your machine solving capabilities, you donâ€™t have the option to search for writeups so this anyhow makes you try harder and increases your patience which helps in the exam.</p>

<p>My friends, family and collegues played an important role during my lab phase, they used to motivate me to study and try harder even when I gave up at times.</p>

<p>Things were going on and by 28th August 2021 I was able to root around 70 boxes leaving only 4 boxes from OSCP labs.</p>

<h2 id="after-completing-labs">After Completing Labs</h2>

<p>Earlier when I started I thought to prepare the report for those 5 points but then I changed my mind and enrolled myself in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Offensive Security Proving Grounds: Practice</code>. From 29th August to around 10th September 2021 I had rooted 30-35 boxes. If you want to check the list of boxes, please check this <a href="">link</a>.</p>

<p>In between I took out time to study BufferOverFlow from <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TryhackMe</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling-the-exam">Scheduling the Exam</h2>

<p>12th September 2021, I thought to give it a try without informing anyone except my family, the major tension I had in my mind was if I tell someone that I am thinking to schedule the exam the first thing theyâ€™ll ask is when are your labs ending which is 11th October 2021. This question made me depressed, I used to think am I even prepared or shall I wait for a month and then schedule the exam. I had faith in god and told myself- letâ€™s just go with the exam because I canâ€™t be more prepared than my current situation. Hence, I scheduled my exam for 17th September 2021 at 10:30am.</p>

<h2 id="the-exam-day">The Exam Day</h2>

<p>Thursday Night i.e. 16th September 2021, I laid down on my bed at 10:30pm sharp so that I get some good amount of sleep, anyhow I was so restless the whole night and slept around 2am.</p>

<p>Next morning I woke up at 7:30am, took a bath, had my breakfast and got prepared with all the IDs required for verification. At 10:10am I prayed to god for the final time and logged into the portal, by 10:40am I was done with the verification and started my exam.</p>

<h3 id="time-starts-ticking">Time starts ticking</h3>

<p>Like everyone I started with BufferOverflow and got root on this one by 11:45am - 12 noon, 25 points secured so far.
I took a break for 10mins by the time scanning was going on for the 10 pointer, everything went smooth but my shell wasnâ€™t working due to some error in my Kali machine, it took around 1 hour but still no luck so I thought to move to another one.</p>

<p>At 1:15pm I started with 25 pointer and rooted that at around 3:30pm - 3:45pm. That looked smooth I wasnâ€™t expecting 50 points would be done by 3:45pm, after that I came back to 10 pointer and fixed that error so within 45mins I had root on 10 pointer too. I took a good 30-45mins lunch break and came back at around 5:15pm, I got done wit 20 pointer in next 2 hours so by 7:30pm I had 80 points which were enough to pass.</p>

<p>Though I didnâ€™t express any joy at that point, I was just satified and went for a break. I came back at around 9pm and started with the last 20 pointer machine to go for a perfect score. This machine toubled me alot but anyhow I got the root for it at 12:15am (Saturday morning). Now I had 100 points, checked all the gathered screenshots and asked the proctor to disconnect the VPN at around 1:15am.</p>

<p>I thought Iâ€™ll take some rest and then work on the report, but I was too anxious to finish the exam. So I prepared my 110 pages long report and submitted it at 5:40am.</p>

<h3 id="after-report-submission">After Report Submission</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ll say the anxiety while doing exam is at a different level and the anixiety after submitting the report is all together different.</p>

<p>I was not able to sleep for a single second thinking whether the IPs I have entered are correct or not, the flags I have mentioned matches the correct machine or not. And finally after wating for 25 hours straight I got the result on 19th September 2021 (Sunday) at 6:15am that I have acheived the OSCP certification.</p>

<p>At last I would like to thank all the people who were there with me in my journey, my friends, family, collegues and the most important god who gave me enough strength to pass the examination.</p>
